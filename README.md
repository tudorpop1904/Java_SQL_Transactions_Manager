# Java & SQL Transactions Manager
# Brief Description

This project aims to implement a Java GUI desktop application for managing the transactions and client orders for products from a storage unit. It uses Java for handling the business logic and the GUI components, and it uses a MySQL database for keeping track of every client/customer, product, and a respective order. It also keeps tabs on the bills. The only actor for this project is the order manager, who can add a new client, update their information, delete them, and do the same for each product, order, and bill.

# Required Software and Usage:

A Java IDE and a database management system are required, such as IntelliJ IDEA and MySQL. Create an SQL database with the same name as displayed in the Java code, and create tables which also have the same names as the Java code. Run the application from IntelliJ IDEA and enjoy!
